    <h1>SEO Technique used: Meta tag</h1>
    <p> I used a meta tag by adding a description, keywords, my name and a view optimization for all device sizes.</p>
    <p> An example would be: meta name = "description" content = "Personal Portfolio " </p>


    <h1>SEO</h1>

    <h3>1. Meta Tag</h3>

    <p>Meta Tags are bits of text which describe the purpose/content of a webpage. The meta tags do not appear on the website 
        itself but rather in the head of the HTML. There are four main types of meta tags (meta keyword attribute, title tag, 
        meta description attribute and meta robots attribute (LocaliQ, n.d.). The ones I am most interested in are title tags. 
        Title tags are useful for my website because I can create title tags to attract the most clicks. For example, if someone
         were to search my name, I can create a title tag that attracts the most attention for that specific search. I can make it 
         appear higher on the search results page which is beneficial for when people conduct searches on me for jobs.

    <h3>2. Internal Links</h3>

    <p>Internal links act as pathways which connect the search engine crawlers from one webpage to another within the same website.
         Findings show that a well designed link architecture will help audiences and search engines navigate the website easily 
         (Satya, n.d.). I believe this will be a beneficial addition to my website because it will help users discover new extensions
          to the website and increase website exploration/use. I plan to use this by creating internal links for my resume which 
          bring it to a new page. I will also do the same for my projects. This will enable users to click attributes, 
          go to a new page, view the content and come back to the main page.

    <h3>3. Images and Multimedia</h3>

    <p>Images and Multimedia are often overlooked when thinking about search engine optimization. This is due to the search engine being unable to interpret what the image or piece of media is demonstrating. By providing keywords, alternative/descriptive text, the search engine can understand what the multimedia is demonstrating. For my website this will be extremely useful. Due to data privacy, I will not be able to give full access to projects. I can use this opportunity to show images and videos of my projects while providing embedded text to increase SEO visibility.

    <h3>1. Creating Shareable Content</h3>

    <p>Creating shareable content is a key part of todays social media. Sharing content is a form of recognition which signifies the importance of the content similar to likes/comments. Shareable content is often unique and demonstrates an element which is different compared to other posts (Rohit, 2010). I find this technique to be useful because as I build my personal portfolio website, I think it is important to differentiate myself from the rest. I plan to do this by creating unique projects, along with frequent updates which demonstrate my skills. From a recruiter/manager’s point of view, this may seem effective compared to generic content.

    <h3>2. Easy Sharing</h3>

    <p>Easy sharing is a great way to increase interaction on the webpage. By implementing a feature which enables users to share content on my webpage with a single click, it will promote engagement. Users are more inclined to share the content because it does not require multiple steps (Rohit, 2010). By adding a function, users can select the social media of their choice and directly share the content to that platform. A great way to implement this solution is by adding a button under the media which outlets various social platforms.

    <h3>3. Optimizing Posting Schedule</h3>

    <p> For individuals who use post frequently, optimizing posting time is a great way to increase engagement. During specific times of the day, social media usage increases for reasons such as people get off work (eclincher, 2024). By identifying these times, webpage/social media owners can schedule posts to roll out at a specific time on both platforms. Social media can be used as a redirection to the webpage to learn more about a project update for example. This is a very effective technique because it keeps users frequently engaged and reminds them of your content.
